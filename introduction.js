 ## INTRODUCTION (Exercise 1 of 19)  
   
  To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.  
   
  Run this command to make a directory called javascripting (or something  
  else if you like):  
   
     mkdir javascripting  
   
  Change directory into the javascripting folder:  
   
     cd javascripting  
   
  Create a file named introduction.js:  
   
     touch introduction.js  
   
  Or if you're on Windows:  
   
     type NUL > introduction.js  
   
  (type is part of the command!)  
   
  Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:  
   
     console.log('hello');  
   
  Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running  
  this command:  
   
     javascripting verify introduction.js  
   
  By the way, throughout this tutorial, you can give the file you work  
  with any name you like, so if you want to use something like  
  catsAreAwesome.js file for every exercise, you can do that. Just make  
  sure to run:  
   
     javascripting verify catsAreAwesome.js

console.log('hello');
