 ## NUMBER TO STRING (Exercise 8 of 19)  
   
  Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.  
   
  In those instances you will use the .toString() method. Here's an  
  example:  
   
     var n = 256;  
     n = n.toString();  
   
 ## The challenge:  
   
  Create a file named number-to-string.js.  
   
  In that file define a variable named n that references the number 128;  
   
  Call the .toString() method on the n variable.  
   
  Use console.log() to print the results of the .toString() method to the  
  terminal.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
     javascripting verify number-to-string.js  */

var n = 128;

n = n.toString();

console.log(n);
